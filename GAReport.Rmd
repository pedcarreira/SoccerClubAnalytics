 Google Analytics Case Study
==========================================

## Business motivation
 
## Data Description

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, prompt=FALSE, results='asis'}
setwd("C:/Users/pedrocarreira/OneDrive/Documents/20. P3-BDA/SoccerClubAnalytics/")
source("RunStudy.R")
setwd("./doc")
t1 <- gvisTable(gadata[1:100,],options = list(showRowNumber = FALSE, width = 800, height = min(400,27*(nrow(gadata) + 1)), allowHTML = TRUE, page = 'disable'))
print(t1,'chart')
```

## Questions solved

1. Where do customers come from? Which sites/ads are “feeding" our sales?<br>
    •	69% organic (search engines, 64% google, 2% bing, 1% yahoo, 1% navers, 1% others)<br>
    •	26% direct<br>
    •	5% others<br>
2. Which combinations of sources and mediums attract the more amount of new visitors?<br>
  •	54% organic (search engines, 51% google, 1% bing, 1% yahoo, 0,5% navers, 0,5% others)<br>
  •	36% direct<br>
  •	3% t.co, referral (twitter)<br>
  •	2% m.facebook.com and facebook.com, referral<br>
  •	4% others<br>
3. Is there a correlation between the time a page takes to load and sales? (Are we loosing clients because the site doesn’t load?)<br>
  •	Linear regression shows 0 coefficient for load time and a relatively small coefficient for ln(Load time), but 1 order of magnitude lower than the others<br>
4. Are people who initially came from banners more likely to buy or not?<br>
  •	Users that landed on the website coming from banners have zero purchases<br>
5.	Can we build a model to predict average purchase?<br>
  •	No, a regression for this would yield R2¬=8% but the regressions for quantity or total revenues yield R2¬=99%<br>

## Questions to solve
6. Are there products that are typically bought together (e.g. game tickets and sweaters)? Could we work on some bundles? - ***Cannot test***<br>
7. What are the trends in purchases before the matches? - ***Cannot test***<br>
8.	What are the pages with the highest average time on page? Should we suggest to have more of this content? And do these views lead to sales? – ***ask Javier***<br>
9.	What are the exit rates (Exit rate= exits/pageviews) and can we do something to reduce exit rates? These could represent lost sales – ***ask Javier***<br>
